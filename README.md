# PROJECT 3 - BATTLESHIP

## Overview

My chosen project was to create a Battleships game that can be played inside the Python Terminal window.
The game was created using the Code Institute's Python Essentials Template and deployed on Heroku, displayed in browser-based terminal window.

# Game Rules

The game will first greet the player and asks for a username. Then the game begins by randomly generating 5 ships on both the player's and the computer's board. The ships position is marked with the letter "S".

The game will then prompt the player to enter a column and row number of the location they want to target. In case that position holds a battleship, the game will declare a succesful hit and the position is marked with an " * ". If there's  no battleship at the position, it is declared as a miss and is marked with an "x".

The computer's turn is automated and the result is displayed in an identical way to the player's results.

The player and the computer will take ten turns to find all of the ships. In case the 10 turns pass without finding all 5 ships, the game will state who has had the most hits and display them as the winner.
